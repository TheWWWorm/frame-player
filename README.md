A fairly basic vanilla JS video player for showing videos, as well as weather(uses browser location perms) and time. Mosty for vibe purposes.

Create the "videos" folder in the root folder and put the videos there(mp4, webm, ogv, mkv).

Run npm run start and go to localhost:3000. Enjoy. Best viewed on 21:9 screens, but will work on 16:9 as well.
